First of all, DON'T USE THIS ONLINE UNLESS YOU WANT A VAC BAN.
I don't know if this is detected or not and i will not use this online to find out, but if you use it and get banned don't blame me, this is just a fun weekend project to learn more about game hacking.
If you want to test it tho, use an account that is already banned, if you don't have one, here are some tips:

 * Put Steam in offline mode
 * Add "-insecure +sv_lan 1" to the cs:go launch parameters
 * Turn off your internet. (Make sure you switch to a local json file instead of the downloaded one if you do so)
 * Seriously just don't use it on any account that is not already vac banned


Requirements for the project:

 * Windows, i might try to make a mac version eventuallyâ„¢
 * Python 3 (Only tested on python 3.5)
 * pygame
 * requests

Feel free to add new renderers! I did a matplotlib one as a joke and it was super slow but worked, i might add it later. Web "renderers" would be pretty cool also, it could be used to make a remote radar for mobile phones or other computers.


It is [self updating](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper) so you shouldn't have to change anything after a game update.
